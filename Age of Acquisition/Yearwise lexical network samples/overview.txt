Due to storage limitations, we have stored these networks on the google cloud link mentioned below. Please refer to them for details on yearwise lexical networks.

For calculating the lexical yearwise networks, we consider each year's data, and construct a new network, that incorporates all the cumulative data from the initial year up to the year currently being considered. Thus it is ensured that each year's graph builds upon the previous years' data, hence providing a comprehensive and evolving representation of the lexical network over time.
