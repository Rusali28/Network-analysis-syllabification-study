# Network-analysis-syllabification-study
This project contains the code for the paper 'An Empirical Study of Language Syllabification using Syllabary and
Lexical networks'

Please note: Throughout the contents of the repository, lexical networks have been also referred to as "wordgraphs" and syllabary networks have been alternately referred to as "syllgraphs".

In this work, we consider two parent types of networks:
- **Syllabary networks** : The nodes represent each unique syllable of the language and an edge is generated when two syllable nodes have at least one word in common.
- **Lexical networks** : The nodes represent a word and two words are connected by an edge when they share at least one common syllable
